🧠 Network Flow Data ETL Pipeline (PostgreSQL + Pandas + Python)
📋 Overview
This project demonstrates a scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for network flow data using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL. It processes network intrusion detection datasets containing network flow features for cybersecurity analysis.

⚙️ Features
✅ Automated Database Connection - Connects to PostgreSQL using configuration
✅ Dynamic Table Creation - Creates table with proper schema based on network flow features
✅ Efficient Data Loading - Reads large CSV files using pandas chunks to handle memory constraints
✅ Data Quality Checks - Identifies and handles missing values and duplicates
✅ Batch Processing - Loads data efficiently using psycopg2.extras.execute_batch()
✅ Automatic Schema Management - Creates table with appropriate data types for network flow data

📊 Dataset Information
The pipeline processes network intrusion detection datasets from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity:

Primary Dataset Sources:
. CIC-IDS2017 Cleaned and Preprocessed - Preprocessed version of the CIC-IDS2017 dataset

. Network Intrusion Dataset - Additional network intrusion data from CIC

Dataset Contents:
Network flow statistics (duration, packet counts, packet lengths)

Protocol features (TCP flags, window sizes)

Timing statistics (inter-arrival times, active/idle times)

Attack classification labels for intrusion detection

Various attack types including DDoS, Brute Force, Infiltration, Web Attacks, and more

🔄 ETL Process Steps
1. Extract
Reads network flow CSV files in chunks to handle large files

Combines chunks into a single DataFrame for processing

Supports multiple CIC datasets for comprehensive analysis

2. Transform
Missing Value Treatment:

Numeric columns filled with mean values

Categorical columns filled with mode values

Duplicate Removal: Identifies and removes duplicate rows across all features

Data Validation: Checks data quality and structure

Type Conversion: Ensures proper data types for network features

3. Load
Creates optimized PostgreSQL table with proper data types

Uses batch insertion for high-performance loading

Commits data in manageable chunks (100,000 records)

Maintains data integrity through transaction management

🗄️ Database Schema
The pipeline creates a table with the following structure:

flow_id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY) - Unique identifier

Network features: destination_port, flow_duration, total_fwd_packets, etc.

Statistical features: flow_iat_mean, flow_iat_std, active_mean, etc.

Protocol flags: fin_flag_count, rst_flag_count, ack_flag_count, etc.

Classification: attack_type - Target variable for intrusion detection

🚀 Usage
Configure Database: Update db_config.py with your PostgreSQL credentials

Prepare Data: Download datasets from Kaggle and ensure CSV files are in the project directory

Run Pipeline: Execute the script and enter the desired table name when prompted

Monitor Progress: The script provides real-time updates on data processing stages

⚡ Performance Optimizations
Chunked Reading: Handles large files without memory overflow

Batch Insertion: Uses execute_batch for efficient database operations

Transaction Management: Commits in chunks to maintain database performance

Data Type Optimization: Uses appropriate PostgreSQL data types for each feature
